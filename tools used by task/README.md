# Tools and when I've used them.

While some may view this list as ~~useful~~ ~~a waste of time~~ a list. I intend for this to both serve as a reference for myself and a guie for others.

Often times I find myself using a somewhat obscure tool once followed by an extended period without needing to utilize it. You know what I'm talking about. And then all of a sudden you hit a wall while working on a room, and then it hits you. "I think I've need something simmilar in the past. Oh yeah, it was for that one room that you had to escalate yourself to root using a reverse-php-shell-disguised-as-a-jpeg-that-contains-a-zip-that-once-uploaded-using-a-hidden-form-only-found-with-that-other-tool-i-never-used-before". You know, THAT ONE. And while we probably can find it again with good old ask.com, why not document it? Not just by creating writeups to show everyone that you're -groot- root. 

Now that that's out of the way, here's a cool list, with some fancy clicky things, that should hopefully take you to the section in the room that I did used that obscure tool nmap.
