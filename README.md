# THM-APalmer

This is my personal repository of writeups authored by me as I complete various rooms on THM (TryHackMe.com). This will serve as both an instructional guide, and reference for the methodology, thought process, and tools used (Both successfully, and unsuccessfully).

### Format and Organization

Each individual writeup will consist of the same folder structure and format as shown below.

- Room Name
	- images
		- image1.png
	- scans
		- scan1.txt
		- scan2.txt
	- README.md
