Target machine's IP address is: 10.10.30.98
    -Needed to restart machine due to network issues. The new Target Machine's IP is 10.10.127.132. This is the IP address used after using Nikto.

Connecting to the target machine reveals a webpage with a banner and some flavor text. 

-Website hosted on the target machine had a title of 'Rick is sup4r cool'
    -Transposition of the character 4 instead of 3 might be a hint later. 

-Viewing the source code on the webpage reveals a possible username: R1ckRul3s
    -With the username being R1ckRul3s, sup4r may indeed be a hint. 
    
-To begin enumeration, I used an nmap scan: nmap 10.10.30.98 -sV -sC -Pn -vv -oA filepath/
    -This revealed 2 open ports.
        -Port 22 (ssh)
        -Port 80 (http)
        
-I followed up with a gobuster scan to find furter information

-gobuster revealed a robots.txt
    -robots.txt contained a single line `Wubbalubbadubdub`
    
-Ending in a deadend I found a tool called `nikto` that can find further files and directories. 
    -Using `nikto` with the command `nikto -h 10.10.30.98` returned that a page called login.php existed. 
    
-Upon visiting 10.10.127.132/login.php, we are presented with a basic username:password form.
    -Viewing the source code for the website reveals how the website processes login       attempts. 
    -Entering admin:admin provides a 'Invalid username or password'
    -Refrenceing the username found in the source code from the main page 'R1ckRul3s' I beleive that this would be the username for this page
    -Hydra seems like the best option to attempt to brute force the password.
