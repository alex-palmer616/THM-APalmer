## Introduction

It's that time of year again! [TryHackMe.com](https://tryhackme.com) has launched its event [Advent of Cyber 2022](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber4)!

This is now their fourth Advent of Cyber event, and the first that I will be doing in realtime as the event happens. 

I had initially not planned on doing writeups for each day, but to get myself back in the habit of good old markdown and to really push myself into a routine, I decided I would do it. 

For those that aren't familiar with the Advent of Cyber event, it is 24 challenges over 24 days with a new challenge unlocking each day from December 1st until December 24th. 

It is oriented and designed for both beginners and those that may have let a little rust build up on some of their skills, and just by answering questions, you are entered in to the prize pool drawings. 

In keeping the spirit of my other writeups, and to follow guidelines for TryHackMe, no direct answers or flags will be given.
## Challenges
